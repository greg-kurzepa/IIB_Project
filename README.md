# Bayesian Updating for Reduction of Soil Parameter Uncertainty Using Strain Data From Axially Loaded Piles

This repository contains the code used for my Masters' Thesis, title above. The technical report `Report.pdf` should be read first. The presentation slides are in `Presentation.pptx`

The file that does Bayesian inference for the linear-elastic soil-pile model is `infer_linearelastic.py`.
The file that does Bayesian inference for the nonlinear API soil-pile model is `run_inference.py`.
